Nowadays I live in Montana. I also rides bikes and run moderately long distances.\nI have degrees in Mathematics (BA, Dartmouth College), Algebra (MA, Univeristy of Montana-Missoula) and Applied Statistics (PhD, University of Montana-Missoula). Graduate school taught me many things, among them that I hate academia and that I love wrangling data. Given the choice between wrangling awesome data and making tons of money, I’ll choose the former. Hence this website."
