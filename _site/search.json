    "text": "Don’t take this too seriously. This is mostly an intellectual exercise for me, based on an interesting method that was suggested to me several months ago. I’m not going to go into the details at the moment, I’m mainly recording the predictions here just to force myself to commit to following up on it afterwards. So I’ll try to update each prediction post with the actual results and a comparison. My expectations for it’s performance at the moment is fairly low.\nThe methodology is also still unfinished. I’m sure I’ll be fiddling with it a lot over the course of the season, but I’m trying to commit to publish these for as many World Cup events as I can. It’s sort of reliant on my having a reliable start list, so if I’m busy or traveling the day before a race, I may not get to it in time, we’ll see.\nFor the moment all I’m going to say is that I’m publishing predicted finishing order for the entire start list. The “Predicted PR” column is the actual value the model outputs, so it gives some relative sense of certainty. Values that are further apart represent more certainty of the gap in finishing place. But they are not probabilities and do not have any particular units.\nAlso, in case it wasn’t clear, I’m not terribly interested in participating in Twitter anymore, so anything I produce this season will be going here."

    "section": "",
    "text": "I thought it might be a decent time to revisit a thing I’ve done periodically, which is measure the diversity of nationalities among the top finishers. There are a ton of different diversity indexes, coming up mostly from either ecology (species diversity) or information theory (think Claude Shannon). I don’t think I’ve been very consistent, but here we’ll use the Gini-Simpson index since it has a convenient interpretation: the probability that two skiers chosen at random (with replacement) are from different nations. The higher the probability, the more ‘diverse’ the nationalities.\nHere’s a plot of this measure for major international distance events going back to the early 90’s.\n\nI want to draw your attention to the separate y-axis scales in each of the panels. This is important to keep in mind, to remember that despite the appearances of how “bouncy” the lines are, the variability in the Top 30 panel is much, much smaller.\nThe variability of the diversity for podium finishers (Top 3) is quite large, which we’d expect since it will be very responsive to dominant seasons by 1-2 individuals, like, say, Marit Bjoergen. The confirmation a lot of fans today should note is the general steady decline in diversity among the men since 2008 or so. The women’s diversity at this level was also the highest in the 00’s and then fell during the heyday of Bjoergen and Kowalczyk but has been climbing back up lately. A similar trend can be spotted at the Top 10 and (kind of) Top 30 levels, although the changes are happening at much smaller scales (again, keep the y-axis scales in mind).\nHere’s the same plot for sprints, going back to 2002 or so. This time I’m using the Top 12, to generally align with the semifinals.\n\nAgain, keep in mind the different scales on the y-axis. The Top 30 level is bouncing around much, much less than the others, despite how jagged the graph looks.\nNot as much of an obvious overall trend here, except that the 2015 season seems to have marked a fairly dramatic transition from a period of relatively high nationality diversity in sprints to one dominated by Norway & Sweden that we’re only sort of coming out of lately."

One interesting feature here is that a lot of the misses are the same between the two methods.\nHowever, my method did significantly better at ordering the top finishers. For only the top 12, my method had a correlation of 0.64, whereas using the FIS sprint points list had a correlation of only 0.24.\nAs for the women:\n\n\n\n\n\nHere my method did slightly worse.

I was poking around with Jan Thomas Jenssen’s race results, given his dramatic win last weekend and found one mostly boring thing, and one slightly confusing thing.\n\n\n\n\nMostly Boring Thing\nHe’s been consistently better at freestyle than classic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSlightly Confusing Thing\nHe did a sprint race where he finished 315th? And it’s not shown in the plot, but in that race his qualification time was 25th. It was a Norwegian junior national championship race from 2015. There must be something about the format of how they ran that sprint race that’s not entirely clear from the results, because a single sprint race with 475 competitors seems dubious, even for Norway.\nMaybe the “real” results were split up by age group somehow that isn’t reflected on the FIS website? I’m not sure. You can check the qualification and final results yourself."

    "text": "I was chatting with some friends of moderately advanced years today about how people anointing Johannes Klaebo as the GoAT should get off our lawn. Or at least get off Bjorn Daehlie or Marit Bjoergen’s lawn.\nIt was suggested that since the number of available World Cup starts has shifted pretty dramatically over the years, a decent way to compare skiers would be cumulative win percentage by age. I’m going to throw in cumulative podium percentage in there as well just for additional perspective.\nI’m taking the win/podium percentage across both sprint & distance events, but I’m excluding the modern pursuit races entirely, as “winning” them isn’t really comparable to anything we’re terribly interested in.\nThe other important note is that we should consider this as a (nearly) complete look from the late 80’s forward. So I’m capturing the skiers of the Daehlie, Vaelbe generation forward, but my data isn’t complete enough from the rest of the 80’s back to examine them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCumulative Win Percentage\nHere’s cumulative win percentage among World Cup, WSC, OWG and TdS races, sprint & distance. Maybe the Klaebo stans should, in fact, remain on my lawn.\nBut Elena Vaelbe probably wins here. (Y’all can argue about doping elsewhere.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCumulative Podium Percentage\nKlaebo looks just as good here, maybe even closer to the standard set by Vaelbe."
