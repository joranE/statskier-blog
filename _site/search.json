    "text": "I am a skier and statistician.\nI raced for much of my youth, from the Bill Koch League through the Dartmouth College Ski Team. I was, at times, not entirely slow. Nowadays I live in Montana. I also rides bikes and run moderately long distances.\nI have degrees in Mathematics (BA, Dartmouth College), Algebra (MA, Univeristy of Montana-Missoula) and Applied Statistics (PhD, University of Montana-Missoula). Graduate school taught me many things, among them that I hate academia and that I love wrangling data. Given the choice between wrangling awesome data and making tons of money, I’ll choose the former. Hence this website."

    "text": "Don’t take this too seriously. This is mostly an intellectual exercise for me, based on an interesting method that was suggested to me several months ago. I’m not going to go into the details at the moment, I’m mainly recording the predictions here just to force myself to commit to following up on it afterwards. So I’ll try to update each prediction post with the actual results and a comparison. My expectations for it’s performance at the moment is fairly low.\nThe methodology is also still unfinished. I’m sure I’ll be fiddling with it a lot over the course of the season, but I’m trying to commit to publish these for as many World Cup events as I can. It’s sort of reliant on my having a reliable start list, so if I’m busy or traveling the day before a race, I may not get to it in time, we’ll see.\nFor the moment all I’m going to say is that I’m publishing predicted finishing order for the entire start list. The “Predicted PR” column is the actual value the model outputs, so it gives some relative sense of certainty. Values that are further apart represent more certainty of the gap in finishing place. But they are not probabilities and do not have any particular units.\nAlso, in case it wasn’t clear, I’m not terribly interested in participating in Twitter anymore, so anything I produce this season will be going here.\n\n\n\n\n\n?(caption)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRuka Classic Sprint\nMen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n?(caption)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRuka Classic Sprint\nWomen"

    "text": "I thought it might be a decent time to revisit a thing I’ve done periodically, which is measure the diversity of nationalities among the top finishers. There are a ton of different diversity indexes, coming up mostly from either ecology (species diversity) or information theory (think Claude Shannon). I don’t think I’ve been very consistent, but here we’ll use the Gini-Simpson index since it has a convenient interpretation: the probability that two skiers chosen at random (with replacement) are from different nations. The higher the probability, the more ‘diverse’ the nationalities.\nHere’s a plot of this measure for major international distance events going back to the early 90’s.\n\nI want to draw your attention to the separate y-axis scales in each of the panels. This is important to keep in mind, to remember that despite the appearances of how “bouncy” the lines are, the variability in the Top 30 panel is much, much smaller.\nThe variability of the diversity for podium finishers (Top 3) is quite large, which we’d expect since it will be very responsive to dominant seasons by 1-2 individuals, like, say, Marit Bjoergen. The confirmation a lot of fans today should note is the general steady decline in diversity among the men since 2008 or so. The women’s diversity at this level was also the highest in the 00’s and then fell during the heyday of Bjoergen and Kowalczyk but has been climbing back up lately. A similar trend can be spotted at the Top 10 and (kind of) Top 30 levels, although the changes are happening at much smaller scales (again, keep the y-axis scales in mind).\nHere’s the same plot for sprints, going back to 2002 or so. This time I’m using the Top 12, to generally align with the semifinals.\n\nAgain, keep in mind the different scales on the y-axis. The Top 30 level is bouncing around much, much less than the others, despite how jagged the graph looks.\nNot as much of an obvious overall trend here, except that the 2015 season seems to have marked a fairly dramatic transition from a period of relatively high nationality diversity in sprints to one dominated by Norway & Sweden that we’re only sort of coming out of lately."
